# Car Price Prediction (Machine Learning)

A machine learning project to predict car prices using regression models.  
Includes preprocessing, one-hot encoding, model comparison, cross-validation, and prediction.

### Features
- Automatic price column detection  
- Handles categorical + numeric features  
- Models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVR  
- 5-fold cross-validation performance comparison  
- Saves final trained model (`car_price_model.joblib`)  

### Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

### Run in Colab
Upload a car price CSV file and run all cells to train and evaluate the model.
